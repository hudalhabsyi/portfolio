### Project 1: 
### Data Analysis of Singapore Weather Conditions and its Effects on the Number of Dengue Cases

#### Overview:
This project aims to analyse trends in Singapore weather and the number of dengue cases between 2014 to 2018. This analysis can be used to help the National Environment Agency plan optimal time periods for the release of the male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes into the environment to enhance effectiveness of Project Wolbachia, which can curb dengue transmission to decrease the number of dengue cases. 

##### Skills and Concepts:
* Basic statistics and probability
* Visualisations using matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn
* Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas and Numpy


### Project 2: 
### Singapore Housing Modelling

#### Overview:
This project makes use of a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dsi-sg-project-2-regression-challenge-hdb-price/data) to predict the house prices using a linear regression model.

As property buyers in Singapore, the affordability of a HDB unit and potential factors that can influence the price are of interest because this can guide them in their planning process before making a purchase. We make use of a regression model to give insights to prospective buyers on factors relating to the HDB unit that affect resale prices. 

#### Skills and Concepts:
* Visualisations using matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn
* Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas and Numpy
* Using Sklearn for
  * Preprocessing: StandardScaler
  * Modelling: Linear Regression, RidgeCV, LassoCV
  * Evaluation: Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R2 Score

### Project 1: 
### Data Analysis of Singapore Weather Conditions and its Effects on the Number of Dengue Cases

This project aims to analyse trends in Singapore weather and the number of dengue cases between 2014 to 2018. This analysis can be used to help the National Environment Agency plan optimal time periods for the release of the male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes into the environment to enhance effectiveness of Project Wolbachia, which can curb dengue transmission to decrease the number of dengue cases. 

**Skills and Concepts:**
* Basic statistics and probability
* Visualisations using matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn
* Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas and Numpy


### Project 2: 
### Singapore Housing Modelling

This project makes use of a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dsi-sg-project-2-regression-challenge-hdb-price/data) to predict the house prices using a linear regression model with ridge regularisation. Our model concudes that HDB prices are cheapest in non-mature estates in the North, West and Nort-east regions in Singapore. As an example, three case studies are explored and recommendations are made based on the data available. Finally, the project also considers certain factors (e.g. noise level, floor plan or orientation of unit) that are not found in the dataset for possible future work opportunities.

### Project 3: 
### "Milking" profits: just knowing how Gen Z and Millennials talk

This project aims to distinguish between Millennials and Gen Z by their language use on Instagram comments to advise companies when evaluating their advertising strategies. Using

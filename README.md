### [Project 3: "Milking" profits: just knowing how Gen Z and Millennials talk](https://github.com/hudalhabsyi/portfolio/tree/main/project_03-webscraping-genz-vs-millennials)

### [Project 2: Singapore Housing Modelling](https://github.com/hudalhabsyi/portfolio/tree/main/project_02-singapore-housing-modeling)

This project makes use of a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dsi-sg-project-2-regression-challenge-hdb-price/data) to predict the house prices using a linear regression model with ridge regularisation. Our model concudes that HDB prices are cheapest in non-mature estates in the North, West and North-east regions in Singapore. As an example, three case studies are explored and recommendations are made based on the data available. Finally, the project also considers certain factors (e.g. noise level, floor plan or orientation of unit) that are not found in the dataset for possible future work opportunities.

**Skills and Concepts:**
* Visualisations using matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn
* Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas and Numpy
* Using Sklearn for
  * Preprocessing: StandardScaler

  * Evaluation: Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R2 Score


### [Project 1: Data Analysis of Singapore Weather Conditions and its Effects on the Number of Dengue Cases](https://github.com/hudalhabsyi/portfolio/tree/main/project_01-weather-effect-on-dengue)

This project aims to analyse trends in Singapore weather and the number of dengue cases between 2014 to 2018. This analysis can be used to help the National Environment Agency plan optimal time periods for the release of the male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes into the environment to enhance effectiveness of Project Wolbachia, which can curb dengue transmission to decrease the number of dengue cases. We conclude that the number of dengue cases spikes approximately 1 month after rainfall and temperature spikes are seen in weather data. Our recommendations are for the NEA to consider timing the release of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes 2-4 weeks before an expected spike in temperature and/or rainfall to maximise cost-efficiency and optimise the use of resources, including but not limited to manpower and community outreach programmes, while reducing the possible ecological impact of each release.

**Skills and Concepts:**
* Basic statistics and probability
* Visualisations using matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn
* Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas and Numpy

18qhor0,My boyfriend is upset. He's getting older and he feels people aren't trying as hard at Christmas.,"I just feel so upset for him. We just opened our christmas gifts this morning, and he got shower gels from pretty much everyone. He tried to not seem upset, but he did eventually start expressing how it made him feel. He feels that now he is a 33 year-old man, people in his life just aren't caring or wanting to try anymore to give him nice gifts this time of year. He really does not ask for much in life, he just always looks forward to Christmas. He puts in  a lot of effort for everyone elses' gifts, and it didn't look like he got the same in return. Even for his secret santa, someone got him golf-balls and he's never expressed any interest in golfing!

&#x200B;

Do people just stop trying when it comes to getting meaningful gifts for the 30-year-old men in their lives? Do we just sound like spoilt brats right now? I really hope not lol. We are super chill, hardworking people so it isn't that we don't know how to be greatful or anything like that. When he told me he's afraid that the older he gets, the more he will just be forgotten, it devastated me. I hate that he feels that way and I didn't know if others his age are going through something similar. I think I'm just trying to get this off my chest to the one sub that I think might understand. I hope you are all having a lovely Christmas! ",15089,10102
185wkry,GenXer’s take on broke millennials and why they put up with this,"As a GenXer in my early 50’s who works with highly educated and broke millennials, I just feel bad for them. 
1) Debt slaves: These millennials were told to go to school and get a good job and their lives will be  better. What happened: Millennials became debt slaves, with no hope of ever paying off their debt. On a mental level, they are so anxious because their backs are against a wall everyday. They have no choice, but to tread water in life everyday. What a terrible way to live. 
2) Our youth was so much better. I never worried about money until I got married at 30 years old. In my 20s, I quit my jobs all of the time and travelled the world with a backpack and had a college degree and no debt at 30. I was free for my 20s. I can’t imagine not having that time to be healthy, young and getting sex on a regular basis. 
3) The music offered a counterpoint to capitalism. Alternative Rock said things weren’t about money and getting ahead. It dealt with your feelings of isolation, sadness, frustration without offering some product to temporarily relieve your pain. It offered empathy instead of consumer products. 
4) Housing was so cheap:  Apartments were so cheap. I’m talking 300 dollars a month cheap. Easily affordable! Then we bought cheap houses and now we are millionaires or close. Millennials can not even afford a cheap apartment. 
5) Our politicians aren’t listening to millennials and offer no solutions. Why you all do not band together and elect some politicians from your generation who can help, I’llnever know. Instead, a lot of the media seems to try and distract you with things to be outraged about like Bud Light and Litter Boxes in school bathrooms. Weird shit that doesn’t matter or affect your lives. 
Just my take, but how long can millennials take all this bullshit without losing their minds. Society stole their freedom, their money, their future and their hope.

Update:  I didn’t think this post would go viral. My purpose was to get out of my bubble after speaking to some millennials at work about their lives and realizing how difficult, different and stressful their lives have been. I only wanted to learn. 
A couple of things I wanted to clear up:  I was not privileged. Traveling was a priority for me so I would save 10 grand, then quit and travel the world for a few months, then repeat. This was possible because I had no debt because tuition at my state school was 3000 dollars a year and a room off campus in Buffalo NY in the early 90s was about 150 dollars a month. I lived with 5 other people in a house in college. When I graduated I moved in with a friend at about 350 a month give or take. 
I don’t blame millennials for not coming together politically. I know the major parties don’t want them to. I was more or less trying to understand if they felt like they should engage in an open revolt. ",14004,3879

Born to parents that were coming out of the drug filled 80's, was raised by my grandparents until I was 6 when my parents, divorced when I was 1, finally kicked the partying and drugs, got their act together and decided to take custody of me. Had to start working at 14 and pay rent to help my family, both sides, with rent and bills. Bought my own beat up first car. Took out student loans to get out of town and go to college, just in time for everything to collapse in 2008. Had to move home to help my parents survive being evicted because of landlords not paying their mortgage and pocketing their rent for years. Terrible jobs in my 20s after our government started two never ending wars, bailed out airlines, car companies, and corrupt banks with garbage wages leftover for us. Finally meet my wife late 20s, and now have extremely high inflation, costs 80k to put a 20% down payment on a house at a 7.5% interest rate for a house that is valued 120k over what it's actually worth...

18pbjn6,"To respond to the ""not all millennial are fucked"" post, let me tell you about a conversation I had with my uncle","I love my uncle, but he's been pretty wealthy for a pretty long time. He thought I was being dramatic when I said how bad things were right now and how I longed for a past where one income could buy a house and support a family. 

We did some math. My grandpa bought his first house in 1973 for about 20K. We looked up the median income and found in 1973 my grandpa would have paid 2x the median income for his house. Despite me making well over today's median income, I'm looking to pay roughly 4x my income for a house. My uncle doesn't doubt me anymore. 

Some of you Millenials were lucky enough to buy houses 5+ years ago when things weren't completely fucked. Well, things right now are completely fucked. And it's 100% a systemic issue. 

For those who are lucky enough to be doing well right now, please look outside of your current situation and realize people need help. And please vote for people who honestly want to change things.

Rant over.

Edit: spelling 

Edit: For all the people asking, I'm looking at a 2-3 bedroom house in a decent neighborhood. I'm not looking for anything fancy. Pretty much exactly what my grandpa bought in 1973. Also he bought a 1500 sq foot house for everyone who's asking

1985hqd,Any other millennials think about dying alone if you have no kids?,"I’ve been watching my sick grandfather go through the process of dying right now and what he wanted was to be around his family at home, not in the hospital. All of us take turns sitting next to him.

Myself (41) , and a lot of friends my age have no children. Since this has happened, I think that when I get old I will have no family and die alone. No family to spend Christmas with, no family or kids to look after me. 

Does anyone else think about these kind of things? Our generation isn’t having as many kids it seems for a lot of reasons but it’s scary to think about spending our older years alone.

EDIT: After reading the replies and discussions, I think I am more sad now than I was before just seeing how most of us millennials look at life, having children, and being alone. It’s very grim. Everyone seems so alone and depressed and accepting of it. Is it normal that a whole generation of people feel so detached or indifferent about the importance of forming family bonds and having kids?

Edit 2- I thought I’d add it’s not that I want kids to take care of me I want kids to have a family and be able to feel loved and surrounded when I’m older instead of alone. I do not want to just have kids to be caregivers. When I said kids to look after me, I meant be there to support each other just like family has done for each other for thousands of years. Our society is built on family at the most basic level. That’s not being selfish. But so many people are talking about kids and family like they have no role or obligations in our lives or say it’s selfish to have kids just because you don’t want to be alone and I find that so bizarre. 

EDIT: I do have a girlfriend, 2 cats and a dog for those of you who DM’d me telling me they hope i die alone… like 4 people DM’d me saying that. ",9152,4540
18kg3kg,"Millennials make more money than any other generation did at their age, but are way less wealthy.

1792zxk,If most people cannot afford kids - while 60 years ago people could aford 2-5 - then we are definitely a lot poorer,"Being able to afford a house and 2-5 kids was the norm 60 years ago.

Nowadays people can either afford non of these things or can just about finance a house but no kids. 

The people that can afford both are perhaps 20% of the population.

Child care is so expensive that you need basically one income so that the state takes care of 1-2 children (never mind 3 or 4). Or one parent has to earn enough so that the other parent can stay at home and take care of the kids.

So no Millenails are not earning just 20% less than Boomers at the same state in their life as an article claimed recently but more like 50 or 60% less. ",9039,2115

17tjeny,Apparently Millennials Put An End To ‘Grin & Bear It’ and I Wholeheartedly Agree!,"I had a conversation with my therapist about millennials, specifically her millennial clients (no names or details obviously). She said she noticed a common trait amongst millennials - we don’t grin and bear it like Gen X and definitely Baby Boomers. 

She said the need to appease elders at the detriment of our wellbeing seen heavily with Baby Boomers is not something we adopted.

We’re the generation that believes in therapy. We’re the generation that made boundaries “cool.” 

I’ve gotten into many arguments with my Boomer mother over my parenting style and decisions pertaining to my work and marriage and it’s mainly because I don’t appease or consider her in my decisions.

I had a friend whose Boomer mother told her she wished she was as brave as her to stand up to her own mother back in the day.

Obviously there are a lot of factors involved, the world changed post 9/11, social media means we're exposed to a lot more horrific things than ever before not to mention echo chambers. There were some really good comments explaining the ways in which life was better for some people during the 90s. But the same could be said about today if you cherry pick the good stuff.

Here's a list of ways the 90s was a shit show in no particular order. Feel free to add your own.

Rodney King and the LA riots

The Waco Seige

The Oklahoma City bombing

World Trade Center bombing

The AIDS crisis

The North Korean Famine

The hole in the Ozone layer

The Gulf War and the Oil Spill

The Yugoslav Wars

The Kosovo War

The Chechen-Russian conflict

The Bosnian Genocide

The Troubles (Northern Ireland)

Civil wars - Sri Lanka, Rwanda, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Djibouti, Algeria, Afghanistan, Burundi, Iraq, Congo... the list goes on

Heaven's Gate mass suicide

The shooting at Columbine

This isn't even including natural disasters, recessions or political scandals. The main difference is that back when all this was going on we were busy watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and sipping on juice boxes at the start of the decade and watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and sneaking booze at the end of it.

The 90s weren't good or bad, better or worse, they were just the years when we were young and carefree.

But this leaves me wondering why babysitting is the only thing talked about in this case. 

I understand not everyone lives close to family that can watch the kids while they go have an adult hangout, but what happened to kids spending the night at friends houses? It used to be a thing that when kids made friends in school, they would spend the night at each others houses and that would serve as a great opportunity for parents to get their adult time.

But now it feels like it’s not just that one friend but almost half the people I know live in homes/apartments that look like they haven’t been cleaned in years.

We had South Park with the “Don’t Sue” Panda because of “Frivolous Lawsuits”. 

And it’s really only a few years ago that it’s become recognized that these frivolous lawsuit claims were corporations trying to avoid accountability.

Edit: to the people who are misremembering the facts:
* Woman was 79 years old. 
* She was the passenger of the car. 
* The car was stationary.
* She had the coffee between her lap. 
* The coffee was heated to a boiling point where two seconds of contact could cause 3rd degree burns. 
* She was wearing sweatpants that absorbed the coffee and spread the damage across her lower half. 
* She asked for $20,000 for medical fees and that McDonalds reduce the heat of the coffee. 
* McDonalds offered $800; they had settled 700 other coffee related incidents that caused burns previously.
* The company knew of previous incidents and did not take action to address the known issue. This was not a lone McDonalds franchisee making their own decision, the temperature was part of policy. 
* In the hearings McDonalds acknowledged that the coffee was too hot to drink when served.
* Jury awarded an insane amount. 
* Judge reduced the amount because the woman had a small amount of fault, but McDonalds was still asked to pay for their own fault.

""People born between 1985 and 1995 [give or take a few years each way] are the most unique generation of all time. Here’s why:

They are in-between two generations: the one before the internet and technology took over and the generation after.

The generation before us was old school and believed in working hard. The generation after us believes in working smart.

We saw it all: Radio, TV, Mario, Waptrick, Nokia, Nintendo 64, Samsung, iPhone, PS4, Tape, CD, DVD, MIXit, MIG32, Netflix, Snapchat, Emojis, and Virtual reality…

The generation before us can be scammed with simple emails asking for money and offering love. The generation after us knows it’s better to have four emails: one for serious stuff, social media, financial transactions and one for experiments for things you don’t trust

We are the generation that knows tradition and question it… picking from it what makes sense to us. The generation before us knew no questions. The generation after us knows no tradition.

We are the gap between the industrial age and the internet age. We understand both sides from experience. We should be running the world! The old guys don’t understand what’s going on anymore; the new guys don’t fully understand where what’s going on came from.""



Edit: give or take a few years. Gen x is before ours. And the general point to the post (I am not the OC) Is that we have witnessed a major shift compared to the generations before ours. 


For those who want to participate in the discussion, this is really fun and cool, for those that would prefer to be above that, that is ofc your right, feel free to scroll away. I don't understand why some feel they need to announce it in the comments. This, like all posts, is not meant for everyone to enjoy discussing, and that's totally fine.

16qygrl,I am tired how we are being destroyed financially - yet people that had it much easier than use whine how we dont have children,"I am a Middle Millenial - 34 years old. In the past few years my dreams had been crushed. All I ever wanted was a house and kids/family. Yet despite being much better educated than the previous generations and earning much more - I have 0 chance of every reaching this goal.

The cheapest House prices are 8x the average yearly salary. A few decades ago it was 4x the yearly salary.

Child care is expensive beyong belief. Food, electricity, gas, insurance prices through the roof.

Rent has increased by at least 50% during the past 5 years.

Even two people working full time have nearly no chance to finance a house and children.

Stress and pressure at work is 10x worse nowadays than before the rise of Emails.

Yet people that could finance a house, two cars and a family on one income lecture us how easy we have it because we have more stuff and cheap electronics. And they conmplain how we dont get children.

Its absurd and unreal and im tired of this.

And to hell with the CPI or ""official"" inflation numbers. These claim that official inflation between 2003 and 2023 was just 66%. Yet wages supposedly doubled during this time period and we are worse of.

Then why could people in 2003 afford a house so much more easier? Because its all lies and BS. Dont mind even the 60s. The purchasing power during this time was probably 2-3x higher than it was today. Thats how families lived mostly on one income.

Then when I was coming of age I learned that president could lie about getting blowjobs that I thought that was pretty bad.

Then I watched an election be decided by courts and not voters. 

Then the economics of the late 90s were shifting and I didn't have any money so I joined the military, and oops – 911 happened.

Then I went to Iraq, so yeah that was fun.

Then I came home and I got through college just in time to graduate college in 2008. Oops again.

Then I got through that crisis and had to manage the PTSD that had suddenly sprung up between 2012 and 2016 because of my aforementioned vacation to the Middle East. 

Then we elected the assiest ass hole ever.

Then in 2019 I FINALLY got some momentum going and I decided to go back to school for nursing, JUST IN TIME FOR A FUCKING PANDEMIC.

I wonder what would've happened if Al Gore had actually been elected, if Bernie had been allowed to run for president, and the pandemic had not hit.

Again, despite all this I have carved out a decent living that I'm proud of, but at 43 it's been pretty bumpy. 

Also again, I know that most generations have had quite the struggle, we are not unique, but our struggle is fact.

EDIT: holy crap tastic this blew up. 

First of all I am not saying that I have had it harder than anybody else in previous generations, heck no. I would still rather be alive today than any other time in history simply because I'm not dying from some horrible but very easily preventable disease/trauma.

Just because previous generations had it harder doesn't mean our struggles are any less real.

Secondly, y'all are funny as hell. 

Finally, as a elder millennial myself, born in 1980, I may be in a smaller cohort than most of all. So my experience may not be the same as yours.

All that being said, please remember that your trauma, your struggles, and your experiences are no less valid just because somebody else had it harder than you.

Now this will no doubt rise as we age, but even adjusted across generations for comparable age levels we have an insanely low divorce rate right now.

Now I was thinking about the possible causes for this.

1. Millennials also have a lower rate of marriage than previous generations which means those of us that are choosing to get married are probably much more committed and prepared than those in previous generations

2. Millennials have the highest rate of college education of any generation and college education is linked to successful marriages statistically (22% divorce rate across all generations if both have a degree)

3. Economic uncertainty may be keeping people together that might otherwise want to split, but I still honestly think factor 1 is the most important here.  Millennials who aren’t prepared for marriage or are unsure of their partner just aren’t getting married in the first place.

In any case this seems like some good news for our generation’s married couples at least. So I was kind of psyched about it.",4406,1318

You think you can take that great job across the country that will help you pay down your student loans faster? Think again.

You aren't going anywhere. Given older Americans' life expectancies, and that there aren't enough nursing home beds to meet the demand, YOU will be their caregiver, and you will most likely do it for free for DECADES.

I dropped out of the workforce to care for my mother, who was frail elderly but sharp as a tack, and it was THE MOST STRESSFUL thing I have ever done in my life.

I loved my mother and she was my best friend, but caregiving means you take a HUGE financial hit you can't afford.

Several states have filial responsibility laws. You are legally obligated to fund your loved one's care.

Mom's on the east coast; you're on the west coast. If you can't hire AND pay for a caregiver for her (or if she refuses to pay for one herself) you're upending your life and moving close to take care of mom.  Even if she lives in bumfuck and there are no good jobs in that area.

Even if you put 20% down you still pay double the cost of the house at  881,142.36.

Why does no one talk about this? I wanted to buy a house but when I learned this I'm so turned off by the idea of spending 400k+ in interest to some fucking bank while also paying insurance for them incase i can't make payments as if they don't get the house if I default already.

How is everybody getting approved for their homes?","I saw somewhere if you want a $200k home, your income should be about $75k to be comfortable. Where I live, the homes are selling for $550k and that means you better be making well into the 6 digits, yet the average income is $65k. That is what is stumping me....how are people getting approved for these homes?!

Edit: where I live in Utah, its actually median income household at $50 - 75k with about 0% built-homes under $200k. so thats great. We also have 24.6% of the population living below poverty line. Yay! ",2996,2010
1803qx6,"Unpopular Opinion: You can't bemoan your lack of a ""village"" while also not contributing to the ""village""","This sub's daily cj over children/families usually involves some bemoaning of the ""village"" that was *supposed* be there to support y'all in your parenthood but ofc has cruelly let you down.

My counterpoint is that too many people, including many of our fellow Millennials, want a ""village"" only for the things that ""village"" can do for them, with no expectation of reciprocating. You can't expect your parents and in-laws to provide free childcare, while never putting a toe out of line and having absolutely no influence over your kids. You can't expect your friends to cook and clean for you so you can recover after childbirth, and then not show up for them, or slowly ghost them as they no longer fit into your new mommy/daddy lifestyle. 

Some of the mentalities I see on Reddit on subs like AITA are just shocking. ""My MIL wants to hold my baby, how do I make my husband go NC and move to the other side of the planet"", ""my family has holiday traditions that slightly inconvenience me, this is unacceptable and I will cut them off from their grandkids if they don't cater to me"", and the endless repetition of ~narcissist narcissist~, ~gaslighting gaslighting~, ~boundaries boundaries~, until such concepts have become more meaningless buzzwords.

EDIT: To anyone who's about to comment ""Well **I** don't want a ""village"" and **I** never asked for one."" Well congratulations, this post doesn't apply to you. Not everything's about you. Have some perspective.",2988,702

198a38n,Is anyone else just tired of working? I can’t seem to put together enough motivation.,"In my early 30s and the entire concept of work is starting to wear me down. I have been working since 16 and all the energy in me is starting to fade. I have done well in my career and even though I am more skilled than I need to be there is still pressure to advance and do more, take more responsibilities. 

I am just getting tired of it all. The concept of work. I do take vacations but the kind of tired I feel is almost on an ideological level.",2910,917

195uxwd,Older millennials - have you come to terms with “ride-or-die” friends now being a memory?,"This happened to both my close friends whom have settled down with spouses & kids as well as single bachelors. I didn’t want to admit it that I was watering a dead plant for a few years after everyone moved away coming out if the pandemic, but I actually now prefer having loose social connections. I tried rebuilding my social life after my last breakup with meetups and although i met some good people I…just….didn’t have the desire to start new close friendships anymore. I’ve come to terms that I’ve aged and changed.

Late ‘20s we’d be out getting drunk every weekend, fast forward 10 years later we still trust and wish good will upon each other but it’s sporadic (but meaningful) texts and a phone call a few times per year.

I think the atomization of society has won and I prefer it now.",2888,865

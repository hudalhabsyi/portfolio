"You can bounce back. 7-8 years ago I was a homeless drug addict who was done trying also and it took jail to get me back on track. Now Im happily married, have a great job making great money. I had to hit rock bottom and experience homelessness to get my shit together. Being homeless is probably the worst experience I have ever gone through and it made me realize things can always get worse. Whatever you’re going thru it helps to have a support network. Maybe look for some groups near you like AA or NA or whatever you flavor is or just talk to friends or family. Whatever you do, don’t give up. I promise you, if it is a substance abuse issue, life is way better without whatever it is."
What kids? I can't afford to have kids.
"My mom thinks you just string together the first letters and everyone just knows what you meant. She'll be on her way to my house, and I get a text that says something like IOMWBFTDDIHTSTPADYWAS?C?
 My mom would have you believe that everyone knows what she meant. I'll help y'all on this first one because you're new. I'm on my way but fuck these damn diuretics I have to stop to pee again, do you want a snickers? Coke?"
"Lots of teen angst going on in here. I like following younger genz stuff to stay connected but it’s the dooming is definitely a pattern I see on Reddit and TikTok.
 I genuinely think younger genZ lost a lot more to the pandemic than we did. It seems like some never recovered and it the negativity just continues. I see so many people say they don’t have friends, don’t go out, and only do solo hobbies etc. Its genuinely concerning.
 I was extremely social in high school and early college, it really helped me function better in society and at school/work. I’m very chronically online now but I still feel better off for my past experiences."
"It’s a Reddit problem. Take all the posts you see with a grain of salt. A ton of the people on the entire website are chronically online, especially the younger ones"
"Yeah lmao it’s funny to watch. My ass moved out at 17 (essentially 16) and been working 60 hour weeks, often across multiple jobs to pay bills, while doing highschool online trying to graduate. And then I go onto reddit and see a bunch of 13-15 year olds talking about how hard it’ll be in the future, even though I guarantee they have their parents full support in life. 30% of Gen Z (adults) are homeowners, the most of any generation other than boomers (32%) by their 20s. Millennials and Gen X had it much harder."
"I just bought one I love!! For way cheaper than yours. I like the looks of yours, but love the looks of my new tumbler better. So sorry! Your ridiculous price loses, and i win!"
"I was skeptical, but took a chance on the Black Friday deal. Haven’t used another cup since it arrived. Everything I drink from it tastes immaculate. My 3rd and 4th cups are in the mail. The Hydration+ and Tea Infusers are great too. Couldn’t recommend more highly."
“if it was cheaper your friends would be mad you didn’t spend more money. also we’re the first cup that ever fits in a hand and that took a lot of money to develop” k
"If we made them cheaper they wouldn’t feel like expensive gifts, and they wouldn’t fit so perfectly in our hand? What? Not selling points if you’re trying to justify the cost/ quality in an ad."

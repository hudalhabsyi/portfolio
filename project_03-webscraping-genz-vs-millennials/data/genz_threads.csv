17qo8zw,Men need to get out of women's sports,"I am a cisgender female athlete who has played at the highest levels of my sport. I'm not giving any more than that because I know psychos here will dox me. I have played with several trans athletes, male & female over the years. And l have a perspective that I think some people need to hear.

Cis women by & large do not care or mind it. It is almost always the men who are the shit stirrers. Inserting themselves into a community & culture that they do not & do not care to understand. If you are one of the handful of women with a problem with it. You know to keep your mouth shut because that opinion is outnumbered 10 to 1. These spaces are dominated by gay women due to the space being traditionally a safe space for those who didn't fit in. Gay women are in favor of trans rights at a rate of 98%

Second, I have never seen one of these ""elite trans athletes"" in my life. I have played with some better than others. However, to say they have an ""unfair advantage"" is something I've witnessed zero first hand evidence for. Maybe there is a higher skill floor. Since I've never met one that was horrible (though that may be as much sociological as anything) but there is def a skill ceiling as well. I assume it's created by the hormones because the best trans woman I have ever played with maybe could have played NCAA D3 if given the chance but probably more of a high level college club player and she is the best I've EVER seen by a lot. However, most trans women I've played with are above all things slow. I presume this comes from the larger frame with subsequently smaller muscles caused by injecting estrogen into your system.

Unironically, this whole ""men in women's sports"" shit you people go on about is a ""men's issue"" because women do not care. So when I see people run around here accusing every pro trans person of being a trans woman. It's unironically a fever dream caused by your bigotry. Where you see trans people under every nook & cranny. Unironically, men need to get out of women's sports...",13552,6566

18w7dq3,The joke I hear at every comedy show,"“You know I’m sorry if you get offended easily, I’m not trying to be canceled by the LGBT-ABCDE community.” 

*Laughter* 

“Nah I’m an ally to the alphabet community, really, I am.”

*Laughter* 

“It’s such a new time ya know. No disrespect but when I was a kid… “ 

I work at a stadium where we sometimes rent out shows to comedians and literally every comedian has said something along these lines. I’m not offended, it’s just SO REPETITIVE. I literally roll my eyes when I hear it now.

Edit: Some people think this particular joke is unique to conservatives or people of a particular political agenda. It is not, it’s unique to oldheads (45+) comedians. And again my problem isn’t that it’s “offensive” it’s that I’ve heard it **8 times before!** It’s usually just a segue into talking about how they don’t understand our generation (that’s why I posted it on this particular subreddit).

196gtpy,"I know “this generation is doomed” media is clickbait, but that little Sephora panic annoyed me","Broadly, people freaking out about the new generation is: extrapolating one demographic’s behavior onto everyone else, an existing problem that got worse because it wasn’t dealt with, or a new version of “back in my day we had better stuff”. 

Other examples that annoyed me specifically: 

- gen z thinks AAVE is internet slang

- gen z gets all their news from tik tok

- the new generation is media illiterate

194xpsb,STOP. BULLYING. CHILDREN.,"

The title of this post is self-explanatory. You guys need to fucking stop bullying literal children. Seriously this is getting way out hand and I am *so goddamn tired* of all the posts/comments/memes shitting on Gen Alpha I keep seeing, both here and in several other subs, as well as outside of Reddit. You know how old the oldest Gen Alpha kids are? 14. They are 14 *at the oldest.* The youngest ones are the ones who will be born this year in 2024. They. Are. *CHILDREN.* 

You are bullying and mocking *children* who are still growing, developing, and figuring out how to do this whole being alive thing. Yeah, they do stupid shit. So did *every other human alive* when they were kids. Yes, even me. Yes, even you, the person reading this. Don’t deny it, you know you did. That’s how how children learn to be humans, by trial and error and figuring things out one step at a time.

Remember when we were in school and we got bullied, not just by our peers but by adults too, for doing things that weren’t even hurting anyone? Remember when we were laughed at and treated like idiots for being nerds, weebs, emos, “weird,” in some way, or literally just whatever those assholes felt like being mean about? Remember how we were always called lazy, spiked, entitled kids? 

Remember how we were constantly told that we’re what’s wrong with the world, and that it’s our fault for all of society’s problems, even though all we wanted was to enjoy our lives and do the things we liked? Remember how much it hurt? Remember how all we wanted was to just live our lives in peace and have fun without having our classmates and the older generations constantly shit on us for it?

Gen Alpha is our younger selves. They’re just like we were back then, struggling to figure out how to navigate this huge, confusing maze of life, wondering how on Earth they’re ever going to make it. They’re growing into their teenage years (You all remember how much being a teenager sucks, or for many of you, still does suck, right? It’s not exactly a great time) in a world that’s frankly straight chaos. Literally *everything* is changing for the 9-14 year old group now. 

The various social dynamics of their lives, their friendships, their relationships with their parents and other relatives, all of that is changing more and more by the day. Their bodies are growing and changing, going from the body of a child to the body of an adult, and along with those physical changes, they’re absolutely brimming with hormones and brand new emotions and feelings that they now have to get used to. They’re at the stage where the world they knew is becoming a totally different one, and they have no choice but to do the best they can to adapt to this brand new world.

Oops, this ended up getting really long, but I’m not even gonna apologize for it. I needed to get this off my chest and an unfortunately high number of people need to read this, because *fuck,* I’m so unbelievably tired of the frankly horrifying and incredibly depressing amount of   hate for Gen Alpha kids. They’re children, guys, they’re literally just children, and what they need more than anything is support, guidance, and kindness. 

The next time you see or hear about a Gen Alpha kid doing something stupid, stop and think before you laugh at them, mock them, or look down on them. Stop and remind yourself that you did stupid shit too when you were their age, that we *all* did stupid shit when we were their age. Remind yourself that this sort of thing is just what children do as they grow up and begin to navigate their way through life, trying to find out what works and what doesn’t. Please, choose to show compassion for these kids who have to grow up, discover themselves and learn how to live in such a chaotic, unpredictable, frightening world. 

It’s up to us to be their role models, to show them how to be kind, intelligent, determined, confident people that can take on this absurd, chaotic, scary world and make it a better place for everyone who came before them and everyone who will come after them. These kids deserve to be able to look to the generation before them and receive the compassion and guidance they’re looking for, not mocking laughter and dismissal. Please, please, *please* just be kind. You don’t have to do anything special or go out of your way, just *be kind,* that’s literally all you have to do. It’s the least these kids, and what all kids in the future, deserve. 

If you actually read this far, I just want to thank you because I really appreciate it, and I dearly hope you’ll take my advice and choose compassion over cruelty. Have an awesome day everyone.",2827,1314
